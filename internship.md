## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the operational standards for interns participating in programs under NTUST supervision, including research-based and industry-based internships. The SOP aims to maintain professional integrity, promote accountability, and enhance technical and collaborative experiences.

> [!NOTE]
> Regulation stated in this docs will be be effective from the published date and may be updated at any time.

## 2. Internship Program Structure

### 2.1 Internship Phases

>[!CAUTION]
>
> Any violation of following policies may result in immediate termination of the internship.

>[!WARNING]
>
> - Internship outside of BMW Lab NTUST is **not** allowed without prior approval from the mentor.
> - Interns are **not** allowed to work on any other projects during the internship period without prior approval from the mentor.

Here’s a refined version of the **Probation Period** and **On-site Internship** sections, with clearer structure, improved grammar, and better consistency in formatting. I've also removed duplicate or ambiguous objective listings and formatted it cleanly for Markdown use:

---

### 1. **Probation Period**

> [!TIP]
> Interns are encouraged to begin the probation period **before the active semester** starts at their home university.

1. **Duration**: Typically 1–3 months (negotiable based on performance).
2. **Weekly Reports**:

   - Submit updates every **Friday by 15:00 (Taiwan Time)**.
   - Report via both **LINE group** and **Trello board**.
   - Minimum reporting duration: **12 weeks**.
3. **Objectives**:

   1. **Background Knowledge Report**:

      - Complete the assigned study materials provided by the lab or company.
      - Purpose: Ensure the intern has the necessary technical foundation for the assigned topic.
   2. **Laboratory Research Project Assistance**:

      - Complete the project or topic assigned by the supervisor.
      - Purpose: Support research collaboration between NTUST and the intern’s home university.
      - **Note**: Interns are free to continue or change their topic after the probation period. It is **not mandatory** to adopt the probation topic as a Bachelor's thesis.

> [!CAUTION]
> Failure on fulfilling the probation objectives may result in termination of the internship.

---

### 2. **On-site Internship**

1. **Commencement**:

   - Begins **only after successful probation** and **mentor approval**.
2. **Work Hours**:

   - Monday to Friday, **09:00–17:00 (Taiwan Time)**.
3. **Daily Logs**:

   - Must be recorded on the **GitHub repository** and **Trello board**.
4. **Weekly Reports**:

   - Submit every **Friday by 15:00 (Taiwan Time)** via LINE group.
5. **Attendance**:

   - Physical presence at BMW-Lab is **mandatory** during work hours.
6. **Evaluations**:

   - Monthly performance reviews by mentors to assess progress and attitude.

7. **End of Internship**
   - Evaluation includes submission of deliverables, presentation of results, and submission of reflective documentation (e.g., testimonial, IEEE paper) described in [Final Deliverables section](#6-completion-and-final-deliverables).

### 2.2 Topic Progression

- If an assigned research/technical topic is completed, interns are **required to proactively request a new topic** via the designated LINE group.
- Lack of initiative may affect continuation status or final assessment.

## 3. Internship Documentation

### 3.1 Repository and File Structure

- Interns must establish a GitHub repository and maintain the following:
  - `README.md` with personal profile and project summary.
  - Topic-based folders for documentation and source files.
  - `./daily-log.md` for detailed progress tracking.

### 3.2 Daily Log Format

## 4. Communication Protocols

1. **Trello** – Used for daily check-ins, task tracking, and progress summaries.  
2. **GitHub** – Platform for hosting code, documentation, and daily logs.  
3. **LINE Group**:  
   - Main Lab Group: For thesis and academic research.  
   - Company Group: For industrial project discussions.

### 4.2 Etiquette and Conduct

- Interns must:
  1. Actively engage in technical discussions within the LINE group to foster peer learning.
  2. Acknowledge all messages and instructions with responses or reactions.
  3. Use **private messages only for personal matters**; technical questions must be raised publicly.
  4. Acknowledge broadcast announcements via emoji or stickers in the group chat.

### 4.3 Confidentiality and Information Security

Interns are strictly prohibited from **disclosing any internal laboratory information**—including:

1. research plans
2. progress updates
3. lab conditions  

to any external parties outside the lab without explicit authorization from their mentor or supervisor.

> [!CAUTION]
> Breaches of confidentiality may result in immediate termination of the internship and further disciplinary action.
