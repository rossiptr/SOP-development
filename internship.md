> 3. Each **milestone** should be documented as a **separate study note** (`.md` file).
> 4. Each **task** should be a **section header** (`###`) inside the corresponding milestone note.
> 5. For every GitHub link reference in the daily log:
>
>    * a. Include the **commit tree** link showing the work.
>    * b. Include the **header anchor** link pointing to the relevant task section in the study note.

  - Updating Trello (activity and status log).
  - Posting a weekly report in the designated LINE group **every Friday by 15:00 (Taiwan Time)** in the following format:

```markdown
🔧 This week’s work:  
⚙️ Problems faced:  
✅ Milestones achieved:  
🧭 Plan for next week:  
🔗 GitHub link (installation/user guide):

## 4. Communication Protocols

### 4.1 Channels of Communication

> [!TIP]
> Always check the messages in the LINE group and Trello board for the latest updates and important announcements.

## 🛠️ Tools & Communication Guidelines

1. **GitHub** – Used for hosting source code, documentation, milestones, and daily logs.  
2. **Trello** – Serves as the internship dashboard for milestone tracking and automated daily log updates (via GitHub integration/scripting).  
3. **LINE Group**:  
   - **Main Lab Group** – For thesis-related and academic research discussions.  
   - **Company Group** – For industrial project collaboration and updates.

> [!WARNING]
> 🔒 **Communication Rules**
>
> - All **technical discussions** and **project-related inquiries** must take place in the appropriate LINE group.  
> - **Private messages** should only be used for personal or sensitive matters.  
> - Interns **must respond** promptly to all messages and instructions in the LINE group.  
> - ⚠️ If a mentor initiates a technical discussion in a private message, **interns must redirect the conversation to the LINE group** for transparency and accountability.


### 4.2 Confidentiality and Information Security

> [!TIP]
> If you are unsure whether certain information can be shared externally, always consult your mentor or supervisor before disclosing anything.

Interns are strictly prohibited from **disclosing any internal laboratory information**, including:

1. research plans
2. progress updates
3. lab conditions  

to any external parties outside the lab without explicit authorization from their mentor or supervisor.

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ Breaches of confidentiality may result in immediate termination of the internship and further disciplinary action.

## 5. Industrial Internship Policy

### 5.1 Background Knowledge and Training

- Host companies are expected to provide sufficient technical background and mentorship.  
- If the intern fails to submit a background knowledge study report related to the industrial topic, **NTUST reserves the right to revoke the internship opportunity**.

### 5.2 Commitment Expectations

- Interns are prohibited from participating in concurrent internships unless formally approved.
