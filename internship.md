> 2. Use a single `##` section header for each **task** within a milestone.
> 3. GitHub can auto-generate a **Table of Contents** from headers. Use a plugin if a static ToC is needed.
> 4. Focus on **one milestone per day**. If finished early, move on to the next milestone.
> 5. In the **daily log**, for every GitHub reference:
>    a. Add a link to the **commit tree** showing the work.  
>    b. Add a link to the **header anchor** of the relevant task in the study note.
>
> 🗒️ **GitHub Reference Example**: https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/SOP/blob/25a0c1dd623a4ceb0d5855b20167e0d4963bf108/paper-writing.md#tips-for-paper-writing

### 3.3 Weekly Reporting

> [!TIP]
> When posting your weekly report, always include direct links to the relevant Trello card or GitHub repository for easy reference by mentors.

- Interns must summarize weekly progress by:
  - Updating Trello (activity and status log).
  - Posting a weekly report in the designated LINE group **every Friday by 15:00 (Taiwan Time)** in the following format:

```markdown
🔧 This week’s work:  
⚙️ Problems faced:  
✅ Milestones achieved:  
🧭 Plan for next week:  
🔗 GitHub link (installation/user guide):
```

## 4. Communication Protocols

### 4.1 Channels of Communication

> [!TIP]
> Always check the messages in the LINE group and Trello board for the latest updates and important announcements.

## 🛠️ Tools & Communication Guidelines

1. **GitHub** – Used for hosting source code, documentation, milestones, and daily logs.  
2. **Trello** – Serves as the internship dashboard for milestone tracking and automated daily log updates (via GitHub integration/scripting).  
3. **LINE Group**:  
   - **Main Lab Group** – For thesis-related and academic research discussions.  
   - **Company Group** – For industrial project collaboration and updates.

> [!WARNING]
> 🔒 **Communication Rules**
>
> - All **technical discussions** and **project-related inquiries** must take place in the appropriate LINE group.  
> - **Private messages** should only be used for personal or sensitive matters.  
> - Interns **must respond** promptly to all messages and instructions in the LINE group.  
> - ⚠️ If a mentor initiates a technical discussion in a private message, **interns must redirect the conversation to the LINE group** for transparency and accountability.


### 4.2 Confidentiality and Information Security

> [!TIP]
> If you are unsure whether certain information can be shared externally, always consult your mentor or supervisor before disclosing anything.

Interns are strictly prohibited from **disclosing any internal laboratory information**, including:

1. research plans
2. progress updates
3. lab conditions  

to any external parties outside the lab without explicit authorization from their mentor or supervisor.

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ Breaches of confidentiality may result in immediate termination of the internship and further disciplinary action.

## 5. Mentoring Intern Candidates

### 5.1 Intern Candidate Overview

An **intern candidate** (also referred to as an **apprentice**) is an individual who is interested in joining the BMW-Lab NTUST TEEP internship program in the future. These candidates participate in the **Intern Candidate Program** to develop foundational skills and demonstrate their suitability for the program.

**Program Characteristics:**

- **Duration**: 2-6 months
- **Commitment**: Flexible hours, at least 1 progress log per week
- **Primary Mentor**: Assigned lab intern
- **Target Audience**: Undergraduate students in related technical fields interested in becoming master students at NTUST

**Eligibility Criteria:**

- Undergraduate students in related technical fields
- Interested in joining BMW Lab NTUST TEEP internship program
- Interested in becoming a master student at NTUST

### 5.2 Intern Responsibilities as Mentors

Current interns may be assigned an **intern candidate apprentice** to mentor during their candidacy period, the interns may give guidance and tasks to the apprentice to help them build foundational skills and also aleviate the workload of the mentor. 

**Intern Mentor Duties:**

- Provide structured learning path for the apprentice
- Review progress of the apprentice regularly
- Offer guidance and technical support
- Prepare apprentice for their future internship
- Ensure apprentice follows proper documentation and reporting procedures

**Apprentice Responsibilities (guided by intern mentor):**

- Learn foundational knowledge and skills with mentor guidance
- Create progress logs and weekly reports (study notes, GitHub documentation)
- Assist in tasks assigned by the mentor
- Follow the same GitHub daily log format as full interns
- Determine topics of interest for future research

> [!TIP]
> Being assigned an intern candidate apprentice is an opportunity to develop leadership skills and contribute to the lab's knowledge transfer process while creating a pipeline of skilled research assistants.

### 5.3 Communication and Documentation Requirements

**Communication Channels:**
- Mentor-mentee meetings and chat communications
- **Intern Candidate LINE Group** (separate from main intern group)
- GitHub Progress log repository

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Apprentices must follow the same **GitHub Daily Log Format** as established for full interns
- Weekly progress reports submitted to mentor
- Minimum 1 progress log update per week
- Use established milestone and task tracking system

> [!WARNING]
> **Probationary Nature**: Intern candidates are in a probationary status similar to the intern probation period. They should focus primarily on **foundational knowledge building** and **research skill development** rather than being assigned critical project responsibilities.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Confidentiality Requirements**: Apprentices are strictly prohibited from disclosing any internal laboratory information to external parties. Breaches may result in immediate termination of apprenticeship, rejection of future BMW Lab applications, and further disciplinary action.
