# User Guide Template

> [!NOTE]
> **Purpose of User Guide vs Installation Guide:**
> - **Installation Guide**: Focuses on setup, configuration, and getting the system running
> - **User Guide**: Focuses on how to **use** the system once it's installed and running
> - **System Architecture & MSC**: Only include simplified versions if they help users understand workflows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **When to Include Architecture in User Guide:**
> - ✅ **Include**: Simplified workflow diagrams that help users understand their journey
> - ✅ **Include**: User interaction flow (login → dashboard → feature → results)
> - ❌ **Skip**: Technical infrastructure details (IP addresses, server architecture)
> - ❌ **Skip**: Installation-specific MSCs (deployment sequences)
> 
> **Focus on the user's perspective, not the system's technical implementation.**
