## 1. Repository Management

- **Create a private [BMW Lab GitHub repository](https://github.com/orgs/bmw-ece-ntust)** to upload your project.   
  **Note**: Confirm with manager.

- Ensure all code and documentation are pushed to the repository before the end of each workday.

## 2. Source Code Standards

- All source code suggest follow these standards:
  - Use clear, consistent naming conventions (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Google Style for C++/Java).
  - Use version control best practices (meaningful commit messages, frequent commits, use of branches for features/fixes).
  - Remove unused code and files before each major commit.

## 3. Documentation Requirements

- **Function Documentation:**
  - Every function and class must include a docstring or comment describing its purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions.
  - Use Doxygen (for C/C++/Java) or Sphinx (for Python) to auto-generate API documentation.
- **Class Diagram:**
  - Generate and include a class diagram in the documentation (Doxygen/Sphinx can be configured to do this).

## 4. Core materials

- README that consists:
  - Folder structure
  - System architecture
  - How to run your program
  - For AIML:
    - Dataset
    - Dataset information/spec
    - Model generated from training sample data
    - Step-by-step to train the model including parameter and hyperparameter used
- Provide a detailed **installation guide** (refer to [NVIDIA CUDA installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/)).
- Include a **user manual** explaining how to use the tool, with example commands, input/output formats, and troubleshooting tips.
