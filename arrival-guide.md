## 2 Arrival Day
At the airport,
1. Buy an [EZCard](https://github.com/rossiptr/SOP-development/new/master#transportation-card) at 7eleven, not iCash
2. **DO NOT** activate your SIMcard yet, in the airport and MRT there are free available Wi-Fi, as it might affect your mobile data expiry hour.
3. Go to the lucky draw! (if you fill D-1).

Note: Don't worry, you will have someone pick you up. :D

## 3 Settling In
1. You will have to prepare the dorm:
    - Buy a mattress
    - Top up AC Card

Pro tip: Turn on both AC and fan at night, somehow seems to make the AC card use cheaper

2. [Get UI Number](https://github.com/rossiptr/SOP-development/new/master#ui-number)
3. [Make bank account](https://github.com/rossiptr/SOP-development/new/master#bank-account)
  
**Note**: if they forgot to ask for your 1000NTD, don't forget to deposit it yourself on the ATM, because the government might close your account if it has 0NTD.

4. [Register your activated number in YouBike](https://github.com/rossiptr/SOP-development/new/master#youbike)

## How-To Section

### Taiwan Sim Card:
#### Online
1. Add [INTW ID]() via LINE
2. Send a picture of your passport and visa
3. **DO NOT** discard the SIMcard holder:
    - Your phone number is written on the card
    - They will ask you to take a picture of yourself and the card holder to activate.

**Note:**
- If you don't choose eSIM:
  - Please buy D-7 of departure, as you need the physical item with you. Else, they need to ship to Taiwan (takes 1 week-ish)
  - If you don't have dual SIM slot, you can replace your current SIMcard with the new one, your WhatsApp will still show +62 number and is reachable. However, your +62 number won't be reachable via phone call.
- If you buy eSIM:
  - It's easier but more expensive

#### Offline
1. SimCard is needed for you to make a bank account so as you arrive at the airport go choose a simcard booth.
2. Purchase `IF Card` from the mentor's mutual connections
      - Currently: [Ivan Tantio](http://wa.me/886908489336 "‌").
5. Purchase roaming E-Sim from your original country.

### Transportation Card:
1. EZCard
EZCard is a e-money card that is very versatile, it can help you save time in EZCard-enabled stores (like FamilyMart,etc). 
    - Can be bought on local stores, with a price, and also can be topped-up on the same stores.
    - One of the most important use of EZCard is to rent a bike at **YouBike**.
    - **DO NOT** get an iCash, as it is currently only not as universal as EZCard.
2. i-Pass
    - i-Pass allows unlimited, free of charge commuting for one month (for $1200). If you commute everyday (not on lab grounds), you might have to consider this option.
    - If you are a lab intern, it's highly recommended to just use EZCard as you can travel short distances for free through YouBike.

### YouBike
